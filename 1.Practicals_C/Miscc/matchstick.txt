 The game is to be played beteen the computer and a user with a condition that Computer wins always. 
 It also includes certain rules alongwith the condition:
 1. 21 matchsticks 
 2. The player can choose maximum of 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks.
 3. The computer can make a choice after the player doest it.
 4. The last player that is; the one who has to choose the last matchstick looses.

 ISSUES I fACED:
 I was unable to make out what is referred to as "the last matchstick" also how to make the devision of right choices.
 How to settle the win-win situation.

 LOGIC I USED:
 Since we had a bunch of 21 matchsticks, the last one will be the 21st matchstick. The maximum matchstick 
 a participant can choose is 4 so the total number of matchsticks needed will be 5. 
 We have to ask the user to choose the sticke out of 4 and keep computers choice alternative to the participant,
 such that it helps us to keep a set rule of 5 matchsticks being used.
 We run 4 set of loop if the condition is fufilled if not the loop continues for more rounds.

 ERRORS I DID

 1. I was taking maximum of 4 matchstick in a single go not concerning of the computer's choice.
 2. I was breaking the code and that resulted in further stoping the code.
 3. I amde big mistakes, first was taking random fuction and not intialising the number of matchstics despite the fact it was fixed.
 4. I tried it with for, while and finally I found do while the best option to go with, because then I was break in place of continue and it caused error if the first value we entered was wrong.
 
 The code was over all easy to understand. The code is not general, it is working.
