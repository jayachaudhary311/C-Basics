/* Loop to reverse the order of the array-

   Assign address of (S â€“ 1)th element(last element of the array) to pointer variable p. 
   Iterate through the for loop and for each iteration the value present at the address p is printed. 
   And for each iteration decrement the value of p by 1.

   Then, the array elements will be printed in the reverse order.*/
